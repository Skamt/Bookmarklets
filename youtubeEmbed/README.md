# Youtube Embed #

A little personal script that helped a lot with my low latency internet connection and my potato computer.

## Description ##

YoutubeEmbed lets you watch Youtube streams/videos as the embed countrepart, which is supposedly less heavy since it doesn't load the whole website.

Inteded to be used as a bookmarklet, so when you are about to start watching your favourite youtuber, you can click the bookmarklet and it will redirects you to the embed countrepart of the stream/video.

Videos in embed form will not be added to your watch history, Which makes it helpfull if you don't want certain videos to convolute your feed ( knowing youtube...). you just have to be quick to click the bookmarklet when the video is starting.
