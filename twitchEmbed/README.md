# Twitch Embed #

A little personal script that helped a lot with my low latency internet connection and my potato computer. 

## Description ##

TwitchEmbed lets you watch twitch streams/videos as the embed countrepart, which is supposedly less heavy since it doesn't load the whole website.

Inteded to be used as a bookmarklet, so when you are about to start watching your favourite streamer, or a VOD, you can click the bookmarklet and it will redirects you to the embed countrepart of the stream/video.

You can also click the bookmarklet while watching in embed mode to open the chat in a second page.
